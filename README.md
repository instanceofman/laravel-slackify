# Laravel Slackify

It is great to send logs via Slack for daily monitoring.

But the way the Slack driver is currently displayed is not really useful for system admin. It is too long and too much junk information.

**Slackify** help to log the exceptions of the system in a more neat way, much more useful information, and be customizable (will be added in v1.1)
